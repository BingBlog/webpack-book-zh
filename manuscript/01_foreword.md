# Foreword
# 序

It’s a funny story how I started with webpack. Before getting addicted to JavaScript, I also developed in Java. I tried GWT (Google Web Toolkit) in that time. GWT is a Java-to-JavaScript Compiler, which has a great feature: [code splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html). I liked this feature and missed it in existing JavaScript tooling. I made a pull request to an existing module bundler, but it did not go through. Webpack was born.

要说到我是如何开始使用webpack的，那是一个很有意思的故事。在沉迷于JavaScript之前，我也使用Java开发。那时我试过GWT（Google Web Toolkit）。GWT是一个将Java转换为JavaScript的编译器，它具有很强大的功能：[代码拆分](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html)。我很喜欢这个特性，但是现有的JavaScript工具中都没有这个功能。我曾向现有的模块构建工具提出了一个请求，但没有通过。然后，Webpack就诞生了。

Somehow the Instagram frontend team discovered an early version of webpack and started to use it for instagram.com. Pete Hunt, Facebook employee managing the Instagram web team, gave [the first significant talk about webpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkTCL6Nqm6Y) at OSCON 2014. The talk boosted the popularity of webpack. One of the reasons for adoption of webpack by Instagram was **code splitting**.

不知何故，Instagram前端团队发现了一个早期版本的webpack，并开始将其用于instagram.com。管理Instagram网络团队的Facebook员工Pete Hunt在OSCON 2014上发表了[关于webpack的第一篇重要讲话](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkTCL6Nqm6Y)。该演讲提升了Webpack的普及性。Instagram采用webpack的原因之一就是**代码拆分（code splitting）**。

I have been following this book since its early stages. It was once a combined React and webpack book. It has grown since then and become a book of its own filled with content.

从早期以来，我就一直在追随这本书。它曾经是一本组合了React和webpack的书。但从那时起，它已经逐渐发展成了一本充满了webpack自身内容的书。

Juho is an important part of the webpack documentation team for the webpack 2 documentation, so he knows best what complements the official documentation. He has used this knowledge to create a book that supplies you with a deep understanding of webpack and teaches you to use the tool to its full potential.

Juho是webpack文档小组的重要成员，这个小组是专门为了webpack2文档组建的。所以他最了解如何补充官方文档。他将这些知识来写到了这本书中，让你能够深刻理解webpack，并教你如何使用该工具以充分发挥它的潜能。
