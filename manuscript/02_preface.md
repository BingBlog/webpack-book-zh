# Preface
# 前言

The book you are reading right now goes years back. It all started from a comment I made at Christian Alfoni’s blog in 2014. I had recently discovered webpack and React, and I felt there was a need for a cookbook about the topics. The work begun in a GitHub wiki early 2015.

你现在正在阅读的这本书要追溯到好几年前。它始于2014年我在Christian Alfoni的博客中发表的评论。在那时我发现了webpack and React，我觉得需要一本关于这个话题的“菜谱”。2015年初，我在GitHub wiki开始了书写工作。

After a while, I realized this should become an *actual* book and tried pitching it to a known publisher. As they weren’t interested yet and I felt the book needed to happen, I started the **SurviveJS** effort. The book warped into "SurviveJS - Webpack and React", my first self-published book. It combined the two topics into one single book.

过了一段时间，我意识到它应该成为一本**真正**的书，并应该尝试把它推介给一个知名的出版商。由于他们不太感兴趣，但我觉得这本书仍然必要，我开始了**SurviveJS**的努力。这本书就是“SurviveJS - Webpack and React”，我的第一本自出版的书。一本书中包含了两个主题。

Given a book focusing only on a single technology can stand taller, I ended up splitting the book into two separate ones in 2016. The current book represents the webpack portion of it, and it has grown significantly due to this greater focus. The journey has not been a short one, but it has been possible thanks to community support and continued interest in the topic.

鉴于一本专注于唯一技术的书可以站得较高，我最终在2016年把这本书分成两部分。目前这本书代表了Webpack的一部分，由于webpack备受关注，这本书的内容也显著增长。这个旅程并不短暂，但是依靠社区的支持和大家对这个话题持续的兴趣，这本书仍然有无限可能，


During these years webpack has transformed as a project. Instead of relying on a single prolific author, a core team including myself has grown around the project, and it has attracted more people around it to support the effort.

在这些年来，webpack已经转变成为了一个项目。不是仅靠一个多产的作家，而是包括我自己在内的一个核心团队，这个团队围绕着该项目仍在持续增长，并且吸引了更多的人来支持这个工作。

There is an [open collective campaign](https://opencollective.com/webpack) to help the project to succeed financially. Also, I am donating 30% of the book earnings to Tobias as he has more than earned it. By supporting the book, you literally support webpack development as most of the profit goes to its core team.

[公开集资运动](https://opencollective.com/webpack)帮助项目在财务上取得了成功。此外，我向Tobias捐赠了本书30％的收入，远少于他应得的。通过支持这本书，您实际上在支持webpack发展，因为大部分利润都用于其核心团队。
